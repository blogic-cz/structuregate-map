//! A KEY THAT REACHES ITS TEMPLATE THROUGH A CLASS FIELD — the render site that is a
//! template NODE, reached one hop later than a carrier.
//!
//! A component may name its translation key in TypeScript and bind the FIELD:
//! `hintKey = 'profile.nameHint'` with
//! `<app-hint [text]="hintKey">`. Both halves are rows the map already
//! resolved, and the `literal` route already reaches the component — but at rank 1, so a
//! key that is ALSO written as a carrier somewhere else loses this site to the stronger
//! route, and `n_paths=1` with `truncated=0` then reports one path and hides the other.
//!
//! IT IS A RANK-4 ROUTE, NOT A UNION ACROSS RANKS. The site published here is a template
//! NODE with its own `gate_chain` — the same thing that makes `template` and
//! `template_string` tie — so it belongs at their rank. Loosening the rank comparison
//! instead would also admit the bare `literal` route, whose site is a `.ts` file that
//! merely CONTAINS the key and proves no render position at all. Admitting those would ADD
//! paths to the intersection `always_gates` is computed over, and dropping a real
//! condition from `always_gates` is the failure this schema exists to prevent.
//!
//! EVERY HOP IS AN ID JOIN, never a name match:
//!   * `members.value` / `assignments.value` — the literal the field holds, matched to a key
//!   * `assignments.target_id` — the field it is written to, resolved by the checker
//!   * `expressions.ast` → `Read.target.row` — the template's own read of THAT declaration
//!   * `template_nodes.gate_chain` — the site's real conditions

/// return is not read - its branches test its parameters, which no gate shares. A `tpl:` link is dropped
/// for the same reason: its hole names the CALLEE's parameter, not anything the field's class holds.
///
/// A RETURN THAT IS A TRANSLATE CALL (a method the config's `i18nCalls` names) holds the keys of its
/// arguments: `return this.translate.get(`a.${Kind[kind]}`)` hands the field the key's text.
///
/// A RETURN IS FOLLOWED THROUGH what it hands back unchanged: a call of another method (`hop(k) { return
/// this.inner(k); }`), once per method and arguments so a cycle ends, and either side of a `??` or `||` or a
/// ternary's arms (`return this.translate.get(k) ?? 'x'`). Neither side carries a condition: `x || 'k'` tests
/// the call's own result, which is the key's text whenever the key renders, and nothing a gate reads. A method of
/// SEVERAL returns hands back through each of them (`if (a) { return this.inner(k); } return '-';`), no branch
/// carried - they test its parameters - while a key one of its returns spells itself is still not read: which of
/// those renders is the branch's choice, and dropping it would publish every choice as always rendered.
///
/// A RETURN THAT WRAPS A TRANSLATE CALL hands it back as well: an object's property values (`{ title: t(k) }`), a
/// list's elements that are no objects, the parts of a `+` chain and the argument of `Promise.resolve`, no condition
/// carried. The argument of any other call is not followed, and an object inside a list is `key_loops`'s, read where
/// the loop variable's property is. A template literal's holes and a method chained on the call are not read.
///
/// A RETURN OF A BARE `let` LOCAL reads every later `=` of it too (`let s = ''; s = t(k); return s;`), the
/// local of the method or of the method an arrow sits in, no branch carried - see `key_follow::Returned::written`.
///
/// A GETTER'S RETURN IS READ THE SAME WAY (`get g() { return this.svc.single(); }`, a free function, a method of
/// the class): the getter is a field whose writes are its returns, so a call it returns hands the template the
/// callee's keys. The return's own `if`/`case` is carried, the callee's is not.
///
/// A FUNCTION IS ENTERED LIKE A METHOD, by its `functions` row: a call of the member's own PARAMETER runs the
/// function the call handed in (`pick(get) { return get(); }` over `this.pick(() => first)`, `$fn_id`), and a
/// call of a `const` local runs the arrow it holds (`const t = (k) => this.translate.get(`a.${k}`)`). A hole
/// naming a parameter the call hands a STRING is that string: `t('alpha')` spells `a.alpha` alone.
/// A call whose `$target` is a FREE FUNCTION (a `function` declaration or a `const` arrow of no class) is entered
/// the same way, when no member of that name sits in the file.
///
/// AN ARGUMENT THAT IS A TERNARY OF STRINGS (nested too, at most 16 spellings in all) is read once per arm, no condition
/// carried: `k(on ? 'x' : 'y')` spells `x` and `y`, never every key the open hole would match. A STRING ENUM's member
/// spells its value (`key_follow::spell`). And a `const` local arrow's OWN template literal naming its parameter is read
/// per call when every call spells it (`key_branches::literal_ways`); one call that does not keeps it a wildcard.
